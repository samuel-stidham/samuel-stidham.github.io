# Introducing Myself

I’m Samuel Stidham — a software engineer with over a decade of experience building full-stack systems, cloud-native services, and large-scale backend solutions. I’m deeply passionate about Computer Science and Mathematics, and I spend most of my time designing clean architectures, automating workflows, and solving complex engineering problems. My work spans PHP, JavaScript, Go, Python, C/C++, Zig, Kubernetes, Cloudflare, and modern CI/CD pipelines.

Outside of engineering, I’m a lifelong fan of Dragon Quest, The Legend of Zelda, Hollow Knight, Stardew Valley, Minecraft, and 7 Days to Die. I love reading, writing, and listening to heavy metal and death metal while building things. My personal projects often explore NLP, LLM integrations, and developer tooling.

My academic goal is to earn my B.S. in Computer Science (Software Engineering) with a Minor in Mathematics, followed by an M.S. in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) and a Master’s in Mathematics. Long term, I want to combine my industry experience with teaching — working as a software engineer by day and teaching university courses in the evenings or online.

This site is a work in progress — a place to host my resume, showcase my projects, and document my journey through software engineering, mathematics, and academia.
