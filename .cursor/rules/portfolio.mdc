# Resume + Portfolio Site – Cursor Rules

> **Note:** For detailed setup instructions, see `AGENTS.md`. This file provides essential context for file-level work.

## Tech & Stack

- This project uses **Vite + Vue** with **vanilla JavaScript** only.
- Do **not** introduce TypeScript unless explicitly requested.
- Use **Vue Router** for navigation between pages like `/resume`, `/projects`, and `/about`.
- Styling must be done primarily with **Tailwind CSS**. Use custom CSS only when Tailwind cannot express something cleanly.
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes, including responsive (`md:`, `lg:` etc.) and dark mode (`dark:`) variants.

## Structure

- Keep separate views/components for:
  - Resume (e.g., `src/views/ResumeView.vue`)
  - Projects (e.g., `src/views/ProjectsView.vue`)
  - About (e.g., `src/views/AboutView.vue`)
- Keep resume content and project data separate from presentation logic where reasonable.
- Use Vue Single File Components (SFCs) with `<script setup>` and `<style scoped>` when additional CSS is needed.

## Dark / Light Theme

- Implement a **global dark/light theme toggle** that:
  - Applies a `dark` class at the root level (e.g., on `<html>` or `<body>` or the Vue root wrapper).
  - Uses Tailwind's `dark:` variants for styling.
- The theme should apply across all routes.
- Theme state may be persisted in `localStorage` as long as the implementation remains simple.

### Theme Toggle Icons

**Note:** Font Awesome will be installed manually. Use the exact classes below.

**Light mode (left side):**
```html
<i class="fa-sharp-duotone fa-regular fa-sun-bright"></i>
```

**Dark mode (right side):**
```html
<i class="fa-sharp-duotone fa-regular fa-moon-star"></i>
```

- The toggle must clearly indicate the current mode and feel responsive and smooth (subtle transitions are preferred, but keep the implementation simple).

## Projects Data

- Projects should be defined in a dedicated **data file** (e.g., `src/data/projects.js`).
- Each project is an object with consistent fields: `title`, `description`, `techStack`, `links`, `tags` (optional).
- The Projects view must **render from this data**, so adding a project means adding data, not changing layout code.
- Layout for projects should be built with Tailwind utility classes (cards, grids, spacing, etc.).

## Styling

- Use Tailwind utility classes for spacing, typography, colors, layout (flex, grid), and responsive behavior.
- Only introduce additional CSS when Tailwind cannot reasonably handle the requirement.
- Maintain a clean, professional look appropriate for a resume and portfolio.

## Deployment

- Site is deployed to **GitHub Pages** with custom domain `samuelstidham.me`.
- Build output must include a `CNAME` file. See `AGENTS.md` for detailed deployment requirements.

## Agent Behavior

- When generating or editing code:
  - Follow the architecture and constraints above.
  - Prefer readable, maintainable code with clear structure.
  - Use Tailwind utility classes for styling by default.
  - Provide **full file contents** when making substantial changes, not just small fragments, unless explicitly asked otherwise.
